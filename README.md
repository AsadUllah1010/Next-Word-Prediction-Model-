# Next-Word-Prediction-Model-
Next Word Prediction means predicting the most likely word or phrase that will come next in a sentence or text. It is like having an inbuilt feature on an application that suggests the next word as you type or speak. The Next Word Prediction Models are used in applications like messaging apps.
# Introduction
Next word prediction is a language modelling task in Machine Learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. This task utilizes statistical patterns and linguistic structures to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided. The Next Word Prediction models have a range of applications across various industries. For example, when you start typing a message on your phone, it suggests the next word to speed up your typing. Similarly, search engines predict and show search suggestions as you type in the search bar. Next word prediction helps us communicate faster and more accurately by anticipating what we might say or search for. To build a Next Word Prediction model:
1. start by collecting a diverse dataset of text documents, 
2. preprocess the data by cleaning and tokenizing it, 
3. prepare the data by creating input-output pairs, 
4. engineer features such as word embeddings, 
5. select an appropriate model like an LSTM or GPT, 
6. train the model on the dataset while adjusting hyperparameters,
7. improve the model by experimenting with different techniques and architectures.

# Conclusion
he code above defines the model architecture for the next word prediction model. The ‘Sequential’ model is created, which represents a linear stack of layers. The first layer added to the model is the ‘Embedding’ layer, which is responsible for converting the input sequences into dense vectors of fixed size. It takes three arguments:
1. ‘total_words’, which represents the total number of distinct words in the vocabulary; 
2. ‘100’, which denotes the dimensionality of the word embeddings; 
3. and ‘input_length’, which specifies the length of the input sequences.

The next layer added is the ‘LSTM’ layer, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) layer designed for capturing sequential dependencies in the data. It has 150 units, which means it will learn 150 internal representations or memory cells. Finally, the ‘Dense’ layer is added, which is a fully connected layer that produces the output predictions. It has ‘total_words’ units and uses the ‘softmax’ activation function to convert the predicted scores into probabilities, indicating the likelihood of each word being the next one in the sequence. The model predicts the next word by calling the ‘predict’ method on the model with the padded token sequence. The predicted word is obtained by finding the word with the highest probability score using ‘np.argmax’. Then, the predicted word is appended to the ‘seed_text’, and the process is repeated for the desired number of ‘next_words’. Finally, the ‘seed_text’ is printed, which contains the initial text followed by the generated predictions. Next word prediction is a language modelling task in Machine Learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. This task utilizes statistical patterns and linguistic structures to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided.
